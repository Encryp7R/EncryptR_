# About Me
### General
Just a dude who likes to program here and there for fun in my free time. My first time with code was with JavaScript when I was roughly 9 or 10 years old. I'd come across it through Khan Academy while looking for anything other than maths to do for "self-development time". The language I used the most to develop my hobby during my younger years was batch though. I would make text-based games in the command prompt and would store save files in fake file types so people couldn't just double click it like a text file, but so that it was still plain text and easy to bring back in. While batch was very limiting, it could run on all school computers, so I could share with friends or set up pranks. It wasn't until I picked up Python at around 16 or 17 that I had found my love language. Python was easy to write in to quickly make a program, and was quick to test and debug.

My proudest creation was probably during my senior years of high school. I made a program for the highest level of mathematics in which we were doing an encryption assignment. A majority of questions required the use of matrices and required students to show working. It was something that could get very tedious to write all the steps out for. When I heard my teacher mention he was setting up a tool in Excel to help him mark, I instantly thought about my own program and got to work. I made it in a `.bat` file to share with friends if they needed some help, and later converted it to a Python program after the assignment's end.

### Languages
Though I started with JavaScript and did try to get into Node.js a bit, I have a fairly basic understanding of the language. I see myself having "decent" understanding at best for languages in general if I were to be completely honest, and that's not something I'm afraid to admit. Coding is a casual thing I do for fun. I never undertook serious study so I don't expect myself to create amazing programs or have amazing, neat and optimised code.
#### Languages that I have some knowledge in however include:
- JavaScript
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- C++
- Batch
- VisualBasic
#### Languages that I have been wanting to get into include:
- Java
- Ruby
- C++ (mastery of the language)
- PHP

### Other
Over time I've found myself enjoying the data science side of code more and more. I'd much rather make tools in that field than a game for example. I've also found myself opening up a bit more to others when it comes to my code. I'm more willing to make them a tool and not worry about the code that I already know isn't great. That's what I feel is best about code anyway. Different approaches, different ideas. One person's code may spark an idea for someone else's project, or help point them in the direction they needed for working around a similar problem they also had. Code allows a lot of creativity, and gives room to discussion with others on expanding features and optimisation.
